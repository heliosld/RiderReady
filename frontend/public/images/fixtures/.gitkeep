# Placeholder Images

This folder should contain placeholder images for fixtures without photos.

Add a generic fixture placeholder:
- `placeholder-fixture.png` - Generic fixture silhouette
- `placeholder-spot.png` - Moving head spot placeholder  
- `placeholder-wash.png` - Moving head wash placeholder
- `placeholder-beam.png` - Moving head beam placeholder

You can create these or use icon libraries like:
- https://lucide.dev/ (we already use this for icons)
- Free fixture silhouettes from manufacturers
- Generic equipment icons

Example sizes: 800x800px with transparent background
